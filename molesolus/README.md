# molecurrent

## Installation

* Select the distribution of choice.
* Download the .iso.
* Burn the iso
  
```sh
lsblk # show available devices
dd if=<path to iso> of=/dev/sdX status="progress"
```

* Run the installer. If it's commandline install, then use documentation or there are some documentation in older mole<distro> repositories.

## After installation

* Boot into system
* Change sudo/doas permissions for user. As root

```sh
EDITOR=vi;visudo # for sudo
# comment in line
# %wheel ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
# %sudo ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
echo "permit <user> nopass" > /usr/local/etc/doas.conf # for doas

# The above is the authors preference.
# If it is too unsecure for some, use
 
visudo # for sudo
# comment in line
# %wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL
echo "permit <user> as root" > /usr/local/etc/doas.conf # for doas (check doas manual for this option)
```

or as user, one can do for doas

```sh
# example
echo "permit <user> nopass" | sudo tee /usr/local/etc/doas.conf
```

* Log out as root, log in as <user>.
* update package manager, eg

```sh
sudo pacman -Syu # Arch based
sudo apt update; sudo apt upgrade # Debian(/Ubuntu) based
sudo eopkg upgrade # Solus (might take some time)
```

* If git is not on the system, install it.

```sh
sudo pacman -S git # Arch based
sudo apt install git # Debian(/Ubuntu) based
sudo eopkg install git # Solus 
```

* Go to $HOME/Documents/ and clone molecurrent repository.

```sh
cd $HOME/Documents
git clone https://github.com/moledoc/molecurrent.git
```

* Run the setup script.

	* includes downloading some programs;
	* changing user shell (to do it manually, check the script);
	* **CURRENTLY SET FOR SOLUS!!!**

```sh
cd molecurrent
sh .setup.sh
```

* check with package manager is used and make symbolic link to correct aliases file. For example

```sh
ln -s $HOME/.config/zsh/.z_apt_aliases    $HOME/.config/zsh/.z_pm_aliases # Debian based
ln -s $HOME/.config/zsh/.z_pacman_aliases $HOME/.config/zsh/.z_pm_aliases # Arch based
ln -s $HOME/.config/zsh/.z_eopkg_aliases  $HOME/.config/zsh/.z_pm_aliases # Solus
```

* The general setup should be done. Some tweaking might be necessary, but it is not covered in this readme.

## molecurrent setup

This subsection describes authors preferences in programs.
Also presents a list of most commonly used programs, fonts etc.

* doas over sudo, but if there is no doas option sudo works fine. Also, for doas and sudo both I use nopass option (using doas/sudo doesn\'t require password). Just my preference.
* program: default terminal(gnome-terminal probably) (+ xterm just in case, if wanted)
* program: drop down terminal: guake 
* program: zsh (zsh-syntax-highlighting)
* program: neovim(nvim)/vim 
* program: firefox
	
	* vim bindings pluggin
	* duckduckgo pluggin
	* addblock (eg ublock) pluggin
	* privacybadger plugin
	* change privacy settings

* program: run launcher that comes with DE; if no runlauncher some good choices
  * dmenu
  * fzf_open script solution
* program: fzf; also use as opener/launcher -- see .scripts/open.zsh
* program: keepass (password manager)
* program: redshift (nightlight, if doesn't exist)
* program: sxhkd or WM/DE default keybindings editor.
* program: htop
* program: fd(-find) (replacement for find; faster)
* program: ripgrep (replacement for grep; faster)
* program: (any gui filemanager is fine (nautilus,nemo,thunar,pcmanfm,dolphin etc))
* program: nitrogen (if there is no wallpaper handling in the DE or WM)
* program: zathura (zathura-pdf-mupdf/-poppler; for viewing pdf\'s)
* program: (gnome-)mpv (video and audio files); vlc for backup, explore mpd for music(?)
* program: IDE/Editor for development (corresponding to the language, eg RStudio,VSCode,Intellij etc)
* program: tmux (multiplexer) -- need to learn to use

* RE-EVALUATING THIS -- might stick with default fonts (unless they have some deficiency -- font: fonts-hermit (might have different package name)
* colorscheme: gruvbox colorscheme, slightly changed (I use gruvbox yellow and black as text and foreground color)
* options: swap caps and esc (not needed if programmable keyboard), setxkbmap -option caps:swapescape 
* options: have keybindings for different language, eg setxkbmap -layout us

## Main keybindings

Ground rules:

* Window managing is centered around **super** key
* nvim/vim managing is centered around **alt** key
* (drop down) terminal managing is centered around **ctrl** key

## Notes

### Cinnamon DE

* To import keyboard shortcuts, make sure dconf-cli package is installed.

```sh
# export
dconf dump /org/cinnamon/desktop/keybindings/ > $HOME/.config/cinnamonDE/wm-settings
dconf dump /org/cinnamon/theme/ < .config/cinnamonDE/theme-settings.conf
# import
dconf load /org/cinnamon/desktop/keybindings/ < $HOME/.config/cinnamonDE/wm-settings
dconf load /org/cinnamon/theme/ < $HOME/.config/cinnamonDE/theme-settings.conf
```

### Budgie DE

```sh
# export 
dconf dump /com/solus-project/budgie-panel/ > $HOME/.config/budgieDE/panel-settings
dconf dump /com/solus-project/budgie-raven/ > $HOME/.config/budgieDE/raven-settings
dconf dump /com/solus-project/budgie-wm/ > $HOME/.config/budgieDE/wm-settings
# import 
dconf load /com/solus-project/budgie-panel < $HOME/.config/budgieDE/panel-settings
dconf load /com/solus-project/budgie-raven < $HOME/.config/budgieDE/raven-settings
dconf load /com/solus-project/budgie-wm < $HOME/.config/budgieDE/wm-settings
```

### gnome-terminal

```sh
# export 
dconf dump /org/gnome/terminal/ > $HOME/.config/gnome-terminal/gnome-terminal-settings
# import 
dconf load /org/gnome/terminal < $HOME/.config/gnome-terminal/gnome-terminal-settings
```

### guake terminal

```sh
# export
guake --save-preferences $HOME/.config/guake/.guakeconf &
# import
guake --restore-preferences $HOME/.config/guake/.guakeconf &
```

### RStudio

* Get gruvbox theme from https://tmtheme-editor.herokuapp.com/#!/editor/theme/Gruvbox (should also be in repo)
* Under 'Tools > Global Options' change keybindings to vim, font to hermit and add gruvbox theme. On Debian/Ubuntu based distribution, package libxml2-dev is needed. Also install 'xml2' in RStudio (will put the necessary package into right place, so no manual intervention needed).

```r
install.packages('xml2')
```


## TODO

* improve this README
* make build more general

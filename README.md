## Synopsis

Contains my old builds of Unix builds (linux and BSD). Now one Windows setup also added

## Purpose

In each build, there are something good or interesing in them:

* documentation
* scripts
* configuration files
* setup ideas

I want to preserve them, but also to not clutter my profile.
So I have gathered them under one repository.
I will **NOT** be giving them detailed readme's (unless they already have one).
Feel free to search for cool ideas/scripts, use documentation etc. I know I certainly will, if there's any need in the future.
